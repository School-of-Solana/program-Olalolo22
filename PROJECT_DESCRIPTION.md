Project Overview
Description
This project is a decentralized tipping application built on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to send SOL tips to any wallet address while attaching a personalized message. Unlike a standard wallet transfer, this dApp creates an on-chain "Receipt" account for every transaction, ensuring a permanent, decentralized history of the interaction. It serves as a practical demonstration of Anchor framework capabilities, including account initialization, input validation, and Cross-Program Invocations (CPI).

Key Features
Send SOL Tips: Securely transfer native SOL from a connected wallet to any recipient on the Devnet.

On-Chain Receipts: Automatically generates a unique PDA (Program Derived Address) account for every tip, storing the timestamp, amount, and sender info permanently.

Message Attachment: Allows users to attach a text note to their transaction, which is sanitized and stored on-chain.

Input Validation: The Smart Contract enforces strict logic, such as rejecting 0-amount tips or messages that are too long.

How to Use the dApp
Connect Wallet: Click the "Select Wallet" button in the top right to connect your Phantom or Solflare wallet (ensure you are on Devnet).

Enter Recipient: Paste the Solana public key of the person you want to tip.

Set Amount: Enter the amount of SOL to send (e.g., 0.01).

Write Message: (Optional) Add a short note of gratitude.

Send Tip: Click the purple "Send Tip" button and approve the transaction in your wallet popup.

Verify: Wait for the green success notification and view the transaction signature in the console or explorer.

Program Architecture
The program follows a standard Anchor architecture designed for stateless interaction with persistent receipt storage. It utilizes a Client-Side seeding strategy to ensure deterministic address generation without race conditions.

PDA Usage
I implemented Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to create a unique history for every single tip.

PDAs Used:

Tip Receipt PDA: Derived from seeds [b"tip", sender_pubkey, unique_seed].

Purpose: To store the specific details of one tip transaction.

Seeds: Uses the string literal "tip" as a namespace, the sender's public key to enforce ownership/identity, and a random seed (u64) generated by the client to ensure every tip has a unique address, even if sent to the same person multiple times.

Program Instructions
Instructions Implemented:

send_tip: The main entry point. It takes an amount, a message, and a unique seed. It performs a CPI to the System Program to transfer the SOL, initializes the PDA account, and writes the transaction data (Amount, Message, Timestamp) to the new account.

Account Structure
The main state account used to store receipt data:

Rust

#[account]
pub struct TipAccount {
    pub sender: Pubkey,      // The wallet that sent the tip
    pub recipient: Pubkey,   // The wallet that received the tip
    pub amount: u64,         // The amount of SOL sent (in lamports)
    pub message: String,     // The personalized note
    pub timestamp: i64,      // Unix timestamp of the transaction
    pub bump: u8,            // Bump seed for the PDA
}
Testing
Test Coverage
I implemented an integration test suite using Mocha and Chai to verify the program logic against the deployed Devnet program.

Happy Path Tests:

Send Tip Successfully: This verifies that a user can send a valid amount (e.g., 0.001 SOL) to a random address. It checks that the transaction signature is generated and the program accepts the PDA seeds.

Unhappy Path Tests:

Invalid Amount Error:This verifies that the program correctly rejects a transaction if the user tries to send 0 SOL. The test expects the program to throw an InvalidAmount error, ensuring the contract logic is much secure.

Running Tests
To run the tests against the live Devnet deployment:

Bash

export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL="https://api.devnet.solana.com"
export ANCHOR_WALLET="$HOME/.config/solana/id.json"
npx mocha -r ts-node/register 'tests/**/*.ts' --timeout 1000000
Additional Notes for Evaluators
This project presented significant challenges regarding dependency management between Anchor 0.30 and Solana 1.18.

Build Process: I utilized a custom Docker environment to compile the Rust backend to resolve glibc and rustc version mismatches on my local machine.

Frontend Engineering: I implemented a custom Webpack configuration to polyfill Node.js core modules (Buffer, Crypto) to ensure the Solana libraries worked seamlessly in a React environment without ejecting.

Design: The UI uses a custom "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with Tailwind CSS to provide a modern Web3 feel.
